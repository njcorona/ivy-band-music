# penn-band-music

I joined the Penn Band my first semester at Penn.  Here, for fun and to learn, I have some basic code visualizing the music of the Penn Band.  Most of the data is compiled from Wikipedia, Spotify, and the data provided to me when I was section leader of the band's drumline.

P.S. There's a little bit of Cornell thrown in, following a brief search for the music of other Ivy League marching or pep bands.
